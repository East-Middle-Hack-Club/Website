<h3>Welcome to the Official website of the East Middle Hack Club.</h3>
<p>Hack Club is an after-school program that was started in September 2019. Members meet on Wednesdays and Thursdays after school in room 428.</p>
<br>
<h3>Our Goal For The Future</h3>
<p>Our Goal is to promote computer science and computer engineering in the minds of middle school students. Our plan is to allow them to explore these subjects and get an idea if they want to continue this in high school and take specialty classes or if they want to take another path. If they like the subject we allow them the time and people to work with to further their skills and help our community.</p>
<br>
<h3>A Message From Our Founder</h3>
<p>Hi! My name is Garrett Thompson, and I founded the East Middle Hack Club. Over the many days I have spent working on this club and the lots of paperwork, I have realized what I want this club to be. I want this club to be a close knit group of student developers, programmers, and computer engineers who always feel like they can always ask anyone in our group a question. I've wanted a group like this for a long time, and I know some of my co-founders feel the same way. But, the only way our dreams for this club can come true, is if we all work together as a team and a family.</p>
