	<h3>Welcome to the Official website of the East Middle Hack Club.</h3>
	<p>Hack Club is an after-school program that was started in September 2019. Members meet<br>on Wednesdays and Thursdays after school in room 428.</p>
  <h3>Our Goal For The Future</h3>
  <p>Our Goal is to promote computer science and computer engineering in the minds of middle school<br>students. Our plan is to allow them to explore these subjects and get an idea if they want to continue<br>this in high school and take specialty classes or if they want to take another path. If they like the<br>subject we allow them the time and people to work with to further their skills and help our community.</p>
